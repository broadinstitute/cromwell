**Cromwell Releases**

The preferred way of getting Cromwell releases is at the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/releases/latest) page. 
You are strongly encouraged to use the latest release of Cromwell whenever possible.

Mac users with Homebrew can also get Cromwell with the command `brew install cromwell`.

This documentation frequently refers to a "Cromwell jar" with a name like `cromwell-<version>.jar`. 
This is the main artifact in Cromwell releases that contains all executable Cromwell code and default configuration.   

[Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html) is required to run Cromwell.
