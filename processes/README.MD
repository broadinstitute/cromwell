# Release Processes

## How to update these processes

Have a better idea about how the deployment process should go? Make a PR and it'll be reviewed, just like a code change!

 * Modify the appropriate `.dot` file(s)
 * Navigate to the `processes` directory 
 * Run `refresh.sh` to update the png files.
 * Add and commit the changed `.dot` and `.png` files to git
 * Submit a PR for the change to be reviewed - and hopefully adopted!
