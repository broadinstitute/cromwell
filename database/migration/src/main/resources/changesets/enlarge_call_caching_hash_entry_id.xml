    <!-- This changeset is misleadingly named. This used to be part of a two-changeset migration that widened the PK and
         then added autoincrement. At the time this was first written the author did not realize that `addAutoIncrement`
         could both alter the datatype of and add autoincrement to the PK in one shot. The changeset cannot be renamed
         as the name is part of the Liquibase key that will prevent it from running again in environments that already
         suffered through the old two-changeset migration. -->

        <!-- This is the original comment from the two-changeset version of the code and it doesn't make a lot of sense in
             the new one-changeset reality. Removing the comment doesn't alter the Liquibase hash but it does make the
             resulting row in the DATABASECHANGELOG different. Keeping it for now out of an abundance of caution. -->

            Factored into a separate changeset from the above to allow for handling various RDBMS implementations differently.
