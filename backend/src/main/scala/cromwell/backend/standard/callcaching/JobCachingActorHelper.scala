/**
  * Base trait for mixins related to caching functionality.
  *
  * This trait is extended by sub traits that provide more functionality for a specific backend. That sub trait  is
  * then mixed into a pair of actors, the first that does the (async-)execution, the second that responds to cache hits.
  *
  * Very closely tied to, but not the same as a BackendLifecycleActor/BackendJobLifecycleActor. Those traits define and
  * implement other methods. Plus, the async-executor actors do not actually extend from BackendJobLifecycleActor.
  *
  * Child job caching actor helper trait implementations should also include the self type:
  * {{{
  *   this: Actor with JobLogging =>
  * }}}
