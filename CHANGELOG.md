# Cromwell Change Log

## 0.20

* The default per-upload bytes size for GCS is now the minumum 256K
instead of 64M. There is also an undocumented config key
`google.upload-buffer-bytes` that allows adjusting this internal value.

* Updated Docker Hub hash retriever to parse json with [custom media
types](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/05b0ab0/docs/spec/manifest-v2-1.md).

* Added a `/batch` submit endpoint that accepts a single wdl with
multiple input files.

* The `/query` endpoint now supports querying by `id`, and submitting
parameters as a HTTP POST.

## 0.21

* Add support for Google Private IPs through `noAddress` runtime attribute. If set to true, the VM will NOT be provided with a public IP address.
*Important*: Your project must be whitelisted in "Google Access for Private IPs Early Access Program". If it's not whitelisted and you set this attribute to true, the task will hang.
  Defaults to `false`.
  e.g:
  
```
task {
    command {
        echo "I'm private !"
    }
    
    runtime {
        docker: "ubuntu:latest"
        noAddress: true
    }
}
```
