# stays in Initializing seemingly forever without making any progress.

# Adapted from `preemptible_and_memory_retry.test`.
# I set `broad-dsde-cromwell-dev` to have super low CPU quota in `us-west3` (Salt Lake City) for this test
# This functionality is pretty married to PAPI, it doesn't run on `GCPBatch` backend.
