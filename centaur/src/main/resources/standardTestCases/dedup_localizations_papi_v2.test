# The test is looking for a Papi v2-style log with combined stdout and stderr for container setup, localization, user
# command, and delocalization. Within that task log the WDL is searching for a particular localization command.
# The GCP Batch backend does not currently have file-based logging of container setup, localization or delocalization.
#
# PR #7529 would provide this file-based logging, but is not a replacement for Papi v2-style streaming logs. The logs
# it produces have some other issues (not streaming within runnables, tons of logs formatting, includes Batch agent
# logs) such that it's not clear we would want to merge it as is.
