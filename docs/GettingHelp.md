**Questions to answer and things to consider:**

1. Who is visiting the Getting Started page?  
*First time with Cromwell*
2. What do they need to know first?  

3. Is all the important information there? If not, add it!  
*Great place for a quick overview of Cromwell, introduction to the different sections of the Cromwell docs*

**Website and User Guide**

The [WDL website](https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl/) is the best place to go for more information on both WDL and Cromwell. In particular new users should check out the [user guide](https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl/userguide/) which has many tutorials, examples and other bits to get you started.

**Support Forum**

If you have questions that aren't covered by the website you can ask them in the [Support Forum](http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/wdl/categories/ask-the-wdl-team).

**Gitter**
There is a [Cromwell gitter channel](https://gitter.im/broadinstitute/cromwell) where people can discuss Cromwell and related topics with both the developers and user community.
