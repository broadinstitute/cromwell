## Local Backend

The local backend will simply launch a subprocess for each task invocation and wait for it to produce its rc file.

This backend creates three files in the `<call_dir>` (see previous section):

* `script` - A shell script of the job to be run.  This contains the user's command from the `command` section of the WDL code.
* `stdout` - The standard output of the process
* `stderr` - The standard error of the process

The `script` file contains:

```
#!/bin/sh
cd <container_call_root>
<user_command>
echo $? > rc
```

`<container_call_root>` would be equal to `<call_dir>` for non-Docker jobs, or it would be under `/cromwell-executions/<workflow_uuid>/call-<call_name>` if this is running in a Docker container.

When running without docker, the subprocess command that the local backend will launch is:

```
/bin/bash <script>"
```

When running with docker, the subprocess command that the local backend will launch is:

```
docker run --rm -v <cwd>:<docker_cwd> -i <docker_image> /bin/bash < <script>
```

> **NOTE**: If you are using the local backend with Docker and Docker Machine on Mac OS X, by default Cromwell can only
> run from in any path under your home directory.
>
> The `-v` flag will only work if `<cwd>` is within your home directory because VirtualBox with
> Docker Machine only exposes the home directory by default.  Any local path used in `-v` that is not within the user's
> home directory will silently be interpreted as references to paths on the VirtualBox VM.  This can manifest in
> Cromwell as tasks failing for odd reasons (like missing RC file)
