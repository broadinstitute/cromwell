For many examples on how to use WDL see [the WDL site](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl#getting-started-with-wdl).

## WDL Support

Cromwell supports [Draft-2 of the WDL Spec](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/master/versions/draft-2/SPEC.md).

We are currently building support for [Draft-3](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/tree/master/versions/draft-3), which is under construction.
