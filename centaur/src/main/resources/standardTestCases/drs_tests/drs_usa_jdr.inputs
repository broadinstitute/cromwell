    # Martha does not return service accounts for JDR paths. Therefore they shouldn't need to be localized using the
    # Cromwell custom DOS/DRS localizer.
    #
    # However, the first file1 was generated before JDR stared saving file names at the end of the gsUri.
    #
    # Thus the JDR generated gsUri for file1 is:
    #   'gs://broad-jade-dev-data-bucket/ca8edd48-e954-4c20-b911-b017fedffb67/585f3f19-985f-43b0-ab6a-79fa4c8310fc'
    # With a fileName of:
    #   'hello_jade.json'
    #
    # While the JDR generated gsUri for file2 is:
    #   'gs://broad-jade-dev-data-bucket/e1941fb9-6537-4e1a-b70d-34352a3a7817/ad783b60-aeba-4055-8f7b-194880f37259/hello_jade_2.json'
    # With a fileName of:
    #   'hello_jade_2.json'
    #
    # The effect of this is that file1 must always be downloaded by the Cromwell custom DOS/DRS localizer which will be
    # sure to download the file to a path ending in true file name hello_jade.json.
    #
    # Meanwhile the gsUri for file2 may be passed directly to specialized command line programs that can read the file
    # name and extension from the end of the GCS path.
