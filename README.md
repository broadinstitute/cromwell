## Welcome to Cromwell

Cromwell is a Workflow Management System for bioinformatics. Cromwell is open source under the [BSD 3-Clause license](LICENSE.txt).

The Cromwell documentation has a dedicated site, [click here to check it out](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable).

### Cromwell capabilities and roadmap

A majority of Cromwell users today run their workflows in [Terra](https://app.terra.bio/), a fully-managed cloud-native bioinformatics computing platform. See [here](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360036379771-Get-started-running-workflows) for a quick-start guide.

Users with specialized needs who wish to install and maintain their own Cromwell instances can [download](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/releases) a JAR or Docker image. The development team accepts reproducible bug reports from self-managed instances, but cannot feasibly provide direct support.

[Cromwell's backends](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/Backends/) receive development resources proportional to customer demand. The team is actively developing for Google Cloud and AWS. Maintenance of other backends is primarily community-based.

Cromwell [supports](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/LanguageSupport/) the WDL and CWL workflow languages. The Cromwell team is actively developing WDL, while maintenance for CWL is primarily community-based.
