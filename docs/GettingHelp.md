_For the Doc-A-Thon_  
**Questions to answer and things to consider:**

1. Who is visiting the Getting Started page?  
*First time with Cromwell*
2. What do they need to know first?  

3. Is all the important information there? If not, add it!  
*Great place for a quick overview of Cromwell, introduction to the different sections of the Cromwell docs*
4. Are there things that don't need to be there? Remove them.

**Support Forum**

If you have questions that aren't covered by this documentation you can ask them in the
[Support Forum](http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/wdl/categories/ask-the-wdl-team).
Please note that despite the `wdl` currently in its name this is a forum that supports Cromwell users.

**Website and User Guide**

The [WDL website](https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl/) is the best place to go for more information on WDL.
In particular new users should check out the [user guide](https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl/userguide/)
which has many tutorials, examples and other bits to get you started.
