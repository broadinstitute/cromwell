_For the Doc-A-Thon_  
**Questions to answer and things to consider:**

1. Who is visiting the Installation page?  
*who needs to install Cromwell?*
2. What do they need to know first?  

3. Is all the important information there? If not, add it!  
*I'd say there's information missing*
4. Are there things that don't need to be there? Remove them.  

5. Are the code and instructions accurate? Try it!
