**Questions to answer and things to consider:**

1. Who is visiting the WDL page?  

2. What do they need to know first?  

3. Is all the important information there? If not, add it!  

4. Are there things that don't need to be there? Remove them.  

5. Are the code and instructions accurate? Try it!

**WDL Support**

Cromwell supports [Draft-2 of the WDL Spec](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/master/versions/draft-2/SPEC.md).

We are currently building support for [Draft-3](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/tree/master/versions/draft-3), which is under construction.
