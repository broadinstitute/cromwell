# Cromwell Change Log

## 24

* When emitting workflow outputs to the Cromwell log only the first 1000 characters per output will be printed
* Added support for conditional (`if`) statements.
* Globs for Shared File System (SFS) backends, such as local or SGE, now use bash globbing instead of Java globbing, consistent with the JES backend.

## 23

* The `meta` and `parameter_meta` blocks are now valid within `workflow` blocks, not just `task`
* The JES backend configuration now has an option `genomics-api-queries-per-100-seconds` to help tune the rate of batch polling against the JES servers. Users with quotas larger than default should make sure to set this value.
* Added an option `call-caching.invalidate-bad-cache-results` (default: `true`). If true, Cromwell will invalidate cached results which have failed to copy as part of a cache hit.
* Timing diagrams and metadata now receive more fine grained workflow states between submission and Running.
* Support for the Pair WDL type (e.g. `Pair[Int, File] floo = (3, "gs://blar/blaz/qlux.txt")`)
* Added support for new WDL functions:
  * `zip: (Array[X], Array[Y]) => Array[Pair[X, Y]]` - align items in the two arrays by index and return them as WDL pairs 
  * `cross: (Array[X], Array[Y]) => Array[Pair[X, Y]]` - create every possible pair from the two input arrays and return them all as WDL pairs
  * `transpose: (Array[Array[X]]) => Array[Array[X]]` compute the matrix transpose for a 2D array. Assumes each inner array has the same length.
* By default, `system.abort-jobs-on-terminate` is false when running `java -jar cromwell.jar server`, and true when running `java -jar cromwell.jar run <wdl> <inputs>`.
* Enable WDL imports when running in Single Workflow Runner Mode.
* Support for sub workflows (see [Annex A](#annex-a---workflow-outputs))
* Enable WDL imports when running in Single Workflow Runner Mode as well as Server Mode
* Support for WDL imports through an additional imports.zip parameter
* Support for sub workflows
* Corrected file globbing in JES to correctly report all generated files. Additionally, file globbing in JES now uses bash-style glob syntax instead of python style glob syntax
* Support declarations as graph nodes
* Added the ability to override the default service account that the compute VM is started with via the configuration option `JES.config.genomics.compute-service-account` or through the workflow options parameter `google_compute_service_account`. More details can be found in the README.md
* Fix bugs related to the behavior of Cromwell in Single Workflow Runner Mode. Cromwell will now exit once a workflow completes in Single Workflow Runner Mode. Additionally, when restarting Cromwell in Single Workflow Runner Mode, Cromwell will no longer restart incomplete workflows from a previous session.

### Annex A - Workflow outputs
    
The WDL specification has changed regarding [workflow outputs](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl/blob/develop/SPEC.md#outputs) to accommodate sub workflows.
This change is backward compatible in terms of runnable WDLs (WDL files using the deprecated workflow outputs syntax will still run the same). 
The only visible change lies in the metadata (as well as the console output in single workflow mode, when workflow outputs are printed out at the end of a successful workflow).

TL;DR Unless you are parsing or manipulating the "key" by which workflow outputs are referenced in the metadata (and/or the console output for single workflow mode), you can skip the following explanation.

*Metadata Response*
```
{
  ...
  outputs {
    "task_output_1": "hello",
    "task_output_2": "world"
            ^
       If you don't manipulate this part of the metadata, then skip this section
  }
}
```

In order to maintain backward compatibility, workflow outputs expressed with the deprecated syntax are "expanded" to the new syntax. Here is an example:

```
task t {
    command {
        #do something
    }
    output {
        String out1 = "hello"
        String out2 = "world"
    }
}
```

```
    workflow old_syntax {
        call t
        output {
            t.*
        }
    }
```

```
    workflow new_syntax {
        call t
        output {
            String wf_out1 = t.out1
            String wf_out2 = t.out2
        }
    }
```

The new syntax allows for type checking of the outputs as well as expressions. It also allows for explicitly naming to the outputs.
The old syntax doesn't give the ability to name workflow outputs. For consistency reasons, Cromwell will generate a "new syntax" workflow output for each task output, and name them.
Their name will be generated using their FQN, which would give 

```
output {
   String w.t.out1 = t.out1
   String w.t.out2 = t.out2
}
```
        
However as the FQN separator is `.`, the name itself cannot contain any `.`. 
For that reason, `.` are replaced with `_` :

*Old syntax expanded to new syntax*
```
output {
   String w_t_out1 = t.out1
   String w_t_out2 = t.out2
}
```

The consequence is that the workflow outputs section of the metadata for `old_syntax` would previously look like 
 
 ```
    outputs {
        "w.t.out1": "hello",
        "w.t.out2": "hello"
    }
 ```
 
but it will now look like 

```
    outputs {
        "w_t_out1": "hello",
        "w_t_out2": "hello"
    }
```

The same applies for the console output of a workflow run in single workflow mode.


## 0.22

* Improved retries for Call Caching and general bug fixes.
* Users will experience better scalability of status polling for Google JES.
* Now there are configurable caching strategies for a SharedFileSystem backend (i.e. Local, SFS) in the backend's stanza:
  See below for detailed descriptions of each configurable key.

```
backend {
  ...
  providers {
    SFS_BackendName {
      actor-factory = ...
      config {
        ...
        filesystems {
          local {
            localization: [
               ...
            ]
            caching {
              duplication-strategy: [
                "hard-link", "soft-link", "copy"
              ]
              # Possible values: file, path
              # "file" will compute an md5 hash of the file content.
              # "path" will compute an md5 hash of the file path. This strategy will only be effective if the duplication-strategy (above) is set to "soft-link",
              # in order to allow for the original file path to be hashed.
              hashing-strategy: "file"

              # When true, will check if a sibling file with the same name and the .md5 extension exists, and if it does, use the content of this file as a hash.
              # If false or the md5 does not exist, will proceed with the above-defined hashing strategy.
              check-sibling-md5: false
            }
```
* Multiple Input JSON files can now be submitted in server mode through the existing submission endpoint: /api/workflows/:version.
    This endpoint accepts a POST request with a multipart/form-data encoded body. You can now include multiple keys for workflow inputs.

        Each key below can contain an optional JSON file of the workflow inputs. A skeleton file can be generated from wdltool using the "inputs" subcommand.
        NOTE: In case of key conflicts between multiple JSON files, higher values of x in workflowInputs_x override lower values. For example, an input
        specified in workflowInputs_3 will override an input with the same name that was given in workflowInputs or workflowInputs_2. Similarly, an input
        specified in workflowInputs_5 will override an input with the same name in any other input file.

        workflowInputs
        workflowInputs_2
        workflowInputs_3
        workflowInputs_4
        workflowInputs_5

* You can now limit the number of concurrent jobs for a backend by specifying the following option in the backend's config stanza:
```
backend {
  ...
  providers {
    BackendName {
      actor-factory = ...
      config {
        concurrent-job-limit = 5
```


## 0.21

* Warning: Significant database updates when you switch from version 0.19 to 0.21 of Cromwell.
  There may be a long wait period for the migration to finish for large databases.
  Please refer to MIGRATION.md for more details.

* There are significant architectural changes related to increases in performance and scaling.

* The biggest user-facing changes from 0.19 to 0.21 are related to the application.conf file, which has been restructured significantly.
The configuration for backends now is all contained within a `backend` stanza, which specifies 1 stanza per name per backend and a default backend, as follows:

```
backend {
    default=Local
    providers {
        Local {
            actor-factory = "cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory"
            config {
                ... backend specific config ...
            }
        }
        JES {
            actor-factory = "cromwell.backend.impl.jes.JesBackendLifecycleActorFactory"
            config {
                ... backend specific config ...
            }
        }
        SGE {
            actor-factory = "cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory"
            config {
                ... backend specific config ...
            }r
        }
    }
}
```
* A new `/stats` endpoint has been added to get workflow and job count for a Cromwell running in server mode.

* Renamed Workflow Options:
   “workflow_log_dir” -> “final_workflow_log_dir”
    “call_logs_dir” -> “final_call_logs_dir”
    “outputs_path” -> “final_workflow_outputs_dir”
    “defaultRuntimeOptions” -> “default_runtime_attributes”

* Timing diagrams endpoint has been updated to include additional state information about jobs.

* Add support for Google Private IPs through `noAddress` runtime attribute. If set to true, the VM will NOT be provided with a public IP address.
*Important*: Your project must be whitelisted in "Google Access for Private IPs Early Access Program". If it's not whitelisted and you set this attribute to true, the task will hang.
  Defaults to `false`.
  e.g:
```
task {
    command {
        echo "I'm private !"
    }

    runtime {
        docker: "ubuntu:latest"
        noAddress: true
    }
}
```

* The Local and the SGE backend have been merged into a generic
Shared File System (SFS) backend. This updated backend can be configured
to work with various other command line dispatchers such as LSF. See the
[README](README.md#sun-gridengine-backend) for more info.

* On the JES and SFS backends, task `command` blocks are now always
passed absolute paths for input `File`s.

* On the SFS backends, the call directory now contains two sub-directories:
    * `inputs` contains all the input files that have been localized for this task (see next below for more details)
    * `execution` contains all other files (script, logs, rc, potential outputs etc...)

* Override the default database configuration by setting the keys
`database.driver`, `database.db.driver`, `database.db.url`, etc.
* Override the default database configuration by setting the keys
`database.driver`, `database.db.driver`, `database.db.url`, etc.

For example:
```
# use a mysql database
database {
  driver = "slick.driver.MySQLDriver$"
  db {
    driver = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
    url = "jdbc:mysql://host/cromwell"
    user = "user"
    password = "pass"
    connectionTimeout = 5000
  }
}
```

## 0.20

* The default per-upload bytes size for GCS is now the minimum 256K
instead of 64M. There is also an undocumented config key
`google.upload-buffer-bytes` that allows adjusting this internal value.

* Updated Docker Hub hash retriever to parse json with [custom media
types](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/05b0ab0/docs/spec/manifest-v2-1.md).

* Added a `/batch` submit endpoint that accepts a single wdl with
multiple input files.

* The `/query` endpoint now supports querying by `id`, and submitting
parameters as a HTTP POST.
