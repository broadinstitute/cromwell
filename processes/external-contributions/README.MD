# How to Handle External Contributions

## Overview

- Decide whether the PR is adding community features or affects "supported" functionality.
- Review the concept
- Review the changes in the PR
- Run CI against the PR
- Cycle through Review and CI until satisfied
- Merge the PR

## Process

### Decide "Community" or "Supported"

**Community Supported:** If the PR only changes parts of Cromwell which are not part of the supported feature set, treat them with a little more
flexibility and with the assumption that the contributor probably knows better than us what they want the feature to do.

**Officially Supported:** If the PR changes core/supported features in Cromwell, review them as thoroughly as you would PRs from within the team. Remember
that one day you might need to support this code!

### Reviewing the Concept

Ask the questions:
 
- Will Cromwell be a better product with this change adopted. 
- Will it be better enough to warrant the time necessary to review the PR
  - Note: The answer to this is almost always a yes if the first answer was yes
  - However, overly long, opaque, or "risky" changes might benefit from requests to break the PR up and merge/review things in stages. 
  
### Review the changes in the PR

- For PRs changing "supported" features, treat it like any other PR coming from within the team.
  - Remember: we will have to support these changes in the future. Possibly forever!
- For PRs only making changes to features we don't officially support - be generous. But make sure:
  - That any new optional functionality is opt-in rather than becoming the default.
  - That any community features are flagged in documentation and config examples as originating from the community (and thus may not be supported by the team if bugs are found).
  
### Run CI against the PR

Note: inspired by the community answer [here](https://github.community/t5/How-to-use-Git-and-GitHub/Checkout-a-branch-from-a-fork/td-p/77).

- Problem: our CI will only run against branches of the `broadinstitute/cromwell` repo submitted by team members.
- To turn a community contribution into a PR that travis will run against:
  - Run the `scripts/make_pr_clone_branch.sh` script, providing the github PR number of the external PR as the command line argument
    - Eg: `scripts/make_pr_clone_branch.sh 5333` to make a PR clone branch for PR #5333.  
  - Push the branch to github
    - Note: The final `git push` command may not work as-is, depending on your ~/.gitconfig value of `push.default`. If it doesn't work then one of the following solutions may work:
      - Setting `git`'s `push.default` config value to be '`current`'.
      - Using `git push --set-upstream origin 5070_pr_clone` instead
      - Using `git push origin HEAD` instead
  - Create a new PR for the clone branch. Indicate that it only exists to test a community contribution. 
    - Example title: `[PR 5333 Clone] PR for CI only`
- If you need to re-sync the clone PR against changes on the remote branch, the same script will *update* your local reference allowing you to force-push changes to the same github branch!  

### Cycle through Review and CI

- If the community contributor makes changes following your reviews or the CI results:
  - Glance at the changes to make sure they still seem reasonable.
  - Make any additional comments
  - Re-fetch the remote reference: `git fetch -f origin refs/pull/860/head:938_pr_clone`
  - Push the changes back up to github to re-trigger the CI on your clone PR.
  
### Merge the PR

- Once the tests have completed successfully and the PR has two approvals, it can be merged.
- Remember to delete your branch clone PR (and the cloned branch itself too!)
