# Cromwell Change Log

## 23

* The `meta` and `parameter_meta` blocks are now valid within `workflow` blocks, not just `task`
* Added an option `call-caching.invalidate-bad-cache-results` (default: `true`). If true, Cromwell will invalidate cached results which have failed to copy as part of a cache hit.
* Timing diagrams and metadata now receive more fine grained workflow states between submission and Running.
* Support for the Pair WDL type (e.g. `Pair[Int, File] floo = (3, "gs://blar/blaz/qlux.txt")`)
* Added support for new WDL functions:
  * `zip: (Array[X], Array[Y]) => Array[Pair[X, Y]]` - align items in the two arrays by index and return them as WDL pairs 
  * `cross: (Array[X], Array[Y]) => Array[Pair[X, Y]]` - create every possible pair from the two input arrays and return them all as WDL pairs
  * `transpose: (Array[Array[X]]) => Array[Array[X]]` compute the matrix transpose for a 2D array. Assumes each inner array has the same length.
* By default, `system.abort-jobs-on-terminate` is false when running `java -jar cromwell.jar server`, and true when running `java -jar cromwell.jar run <wdl> <inputs>`.
* Enable WDL imports when running in Single Workflow Runner Mode.
* Support for sub workflows
* Support declarations as graph nodes

## 0.22

* Improved retries for Call Caching and general bug fixes.
* Users will experience better scalability of status polling for Google JES.
* Now there are configurable caching strategies for a SharedFileSystem backend (i.e. Local, SFS) in the backend's stanza:
  See below for detailed descriptions of each configurable key.

```
backend {
  ...
  providers {
    SFS_BackendName {
      actor-factory = ...
      config {
        ...
        filesystems {
          local {
            localization: [
               ...
            ]
            caching {
              duplication-strategy: [
                "hard-link", "soft-link", "copy"
              ]
              # Possible values: file, path
              # "file" will compute an md5 hash of the file content.
              # "path" will compute an md5 hash of the file path. This strategy will only be effective if the duplication-strategy (above) is set to "soft-link",
              # in order to allow for the original file path to be hashed.
              hashing-strategy: "file"

              # When true, will check if a sibling file with the same name and the .md5 extension exists, and if it does, use the content of this file as a hash.
              # If false or the md5 does not exist, will proceed with the above-defined hashing strategy.
              check-sibling-md5: false
            }
```
* Multiple Input JSON files can now be submitted in server mode through the existing submission endpoint: /api/workflows/:version.
    This endpoint accepts a POST request with a multipart/form-data encoded body. You can now include multiple keys for workflow inputs.

        Each key below can contain an optional JSON file of the workflow inputs. A skeleton file can be generated from wdltool using the "inputs" subcommand.
        NOTE: In case of key conflicts between multiple JSON files, higher values of x in workflowInputs_x override lower values. For example, an input
        specified in workflowInputs_3 will override an input with the same name that was given in workflowInputs or workflowInputs_2. Similarly, an input
        specified in workflowInputs_5 will override an input with the same name in any other input file.

        workflowInputs
        workflowInputs_2
        workflowInputs_3
        workflowInputs_4
        workflowInputs_5

* You can now limit the number of concurrent jobs for a backend by specifying the following option in the backend's config stanza:
```
backend {
  ...
  providers {
    BackendName {
      actor-factory = ...
      config {
        concurrent-job-limit = 5
```


## 0.21

* Warning: Significant database updates when you switch from version 0.19 to 0.21 of Cromwell.
  There may be a long wait period for the migration to finish for large databases.
  Please refer to MIGRATION.md for more details.

* There are significant architectural changes related to increases in performance and scaling.

* The biggest user-facing changes from 0.19 to 0.21 are related to the application.conf file, which has been restructured significantly.
The configuration for backends now is all contained within a `backend` stanza, which specifies 1 stanza per name per backend and a default backend, as follows:

```
backend {
    default=Local
    providers {
        Local {
            actor-factory = "cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory"
            config {
                ... backend specific config ...
            }
        }
        JES {
            actor-factory = "cromwell.backend.impl.jes.JesBackendLifecycleActorFactory"
            config {
                ... backend specific config ...
            }
        }
        SGE {
            actor-factory = "cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory"
            config {
                ... backend specific config ...
            }r
        }
    }
}
```
* A new `/stats` endpoint has been added to get workflow and job count for a Cromwell running in server mode.

* Renamed Workflow Options:
   “workflow_log_dir” -> “final_workflow_log_dir”
    “call_logs_dir” -> “final_call_logs_dir”
    “outputs_path” -> “final_workflow_outputs_dir”
    “defaultRuntimeOptions” -> “default_runtime_attributes”

* Timing diagrams endpoint has been updated to include additional state information about jobs.

* Add support for Google Private IPs through `noAddress` runtime attribute. If set to true, the VM will NOT be provided with a public IP address.
*Important*: Your project must be whitelisted in "Google Access for Private IPs Early Access Program". If it's not whitelisted and you set this attribute to true, the task will hang.
  Defaults to `false`.
  e.g:
```
task {
    command {
        echo "I'm private !"
    }

    runtime {
        docker: "ubuntu:latest"
        noAddress: true
    }
}
```

* The Local and the SGE backend have been merged into a generic
Shared File System (SFS) backend. This updated backend can be configured
to work with various other command line dispatchers such as LSF. See the
[README](README.md#sun-gridengine-backend) for more info.

* On the JES and SFS backends, task `command` blocks are now always
passed absolute paths for input `File`s.

* On the SFS backends, the call directory now contains two sub-directories:
    * `inputs` contains all the input files that have been localized for this task (see next below for more details)
    * `execution` contains all other files (script, logs, rc, potential outputs etc...)

* Override the default database configuration by setting the keys
`database.driver`, `database.db.driver`, `database.db.url`, etc.
* Override the default database configuration by setting the keys
`database.driver`, `database.db.driver`, `database.db.url`, etc.

For example:
```
# use a mysql database
database {
  driver = "slick.driver.MySQLDriver$"
  db {
    driver = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
    url = "jdbc:mysql://host/cromwell"
    user = "user"
    password = "pass"
    connectionTimeout = 5000
  }
}
```

## 0.20

* The default per-upload bytes size for GCS is now the minimum 256K
instead of 64M. There is also an undocumented config key
`google.upload-buffer-bytes` that allows adjusting this internal value.

* Updated Docker Hub hash retriever to parse json with [custom media
types](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/05b0ab0/docs/spec/manifest-v2-1.md).

* Added a `/batch` submit endpoint that accepts a single wdl with
multiple input files.

* The `/query` endpoint now supports querying by `id`, and submitting
parameters as a HTTP POST.
