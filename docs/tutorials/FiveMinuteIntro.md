# Five minute Introduction to Cromwell

### Prerequisites:

- A Unix-based operating system (yes, that includes Mac!)
- A Java 8 runtime environment (if not, get it [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html))
- A sense of adventure!

### Goals

At the end of this five minute introduction you will have:

- Downloaded Cromwell!
- Written your first workflow
- Run it through Cromwell

### Step 1: Downloading Cromwell

We host our Cromwell releases on GitHub! You can find the latest version on our [Releases](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/releases/latest) page.

Head down to the bottom of the page and find the `cromwell-29.jar` link. Note that when you download this, the latest Cromwell version might be higher than 29. That's fine, these instructions will work just as well!
