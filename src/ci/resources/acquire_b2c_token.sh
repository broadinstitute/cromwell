# This script acquires a b2c token using gcloud auth and writes it to a file.
# This file is used by renderCiResources to populate the CROMWELL_B2C_TOKEN in tes_application.conf.
# It should be run as a "Before Launch" task in IntelliJ so the token is refreshed regularly.

### Setting up this script for the first time in IntelliJ? 
### 1. Open the "Run/Debug Configurations" dialog for the TES repo template.
### 2. Add a new "Before Launch" task, selecting "Run External Tool". 
###    This task should run BEFORE the renderCiResources task.
### 3. Configure the new task:
###   - Name: "Acquire b2c token"
###   - Program: /full/path/to/src/ci/resources/acquire_b2c_token.sh
###   - Arguments: ./env.temp
###   - Working directory: /full/path/to/src/ci/resources
###   - Advanced Options > Uncheck "Synchronize files after execution"
### 4. Click "OK" to save the new task. Apply and close the "Run/Debug Configurations" dialog.
