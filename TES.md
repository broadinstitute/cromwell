## GA4GH TES Backend
The TES backend submits jobs to a server that complies with the protocol described by the [GA4GH schema](https://github.com/ga4gh/task-execution-schemas).

This backend creates three files in the `<call_dir>`:

* `script` - A shell script of the job to be run.  This contains the user's command from the `command` section of the WDL code.
* `stdout` - The standard output of the process
* `stderr` - The standard error of the process

The `script` file contains:

```
#!/bin/sh
cd <container_call_root>
<user_command>
echo $? > rc
```

`<container_call_root>` would be equal to the runtime attribute `dockerWorkingDir`  or `/cromwell-executions/<workflow_uuid>/call-<call_name>/execution` if this attribute is not supplied.

### Configuring
Configuring the TES backend is straightforward; one must only provide the TES API endpoint for the service. 

```hocon
backend {
  default = "TES"
  providers {
    TES {
      actor-factory = "cromwell.backend.impl.tes.TesBackendLifecycleActorFactory"
      config {
        endpoint = "https://<some-url>/v1/tasks"
        root = "cromwell-executions"
        dockerRoot = "/cromwell-executions"
        concurrent-job-limit = 1000
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Supported File Systems
Currently this backend only works with files on a Local or Shared File System. 

### Docker
This backend supports the following optional runtime attributes / workflow options for working with Docker:
* docker: Docker image to use such as "Ubuntu".
* dockerWorkingDir: defines the working directory in the container.

### CPU, Memory and Disk
This backend supports CPU, memory and disk size configuration through the use of the following runtime attributes / workflow options:
* cpu: defines the amount of CPU to use. Type: Integer. Ex: 4.
* memory: defines the amount of memory to use. Type: String. Ex: "4 GB" or "4096 MB"
* disk: defines the amount of disk to use. Type: String. Ex: "1 GB" or "1024 MB"

If they are not set, the TES backend may use default values.
