## Website and User Guide

The [WDL website](https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl/) is the best place to go for more information on both WDL and Cromwell. In particular new users should check out the [user guide](https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl/userguide/) which has many tutorials, examples and other bits to get you started.

## Support Forum

If you have questions that aren't covered by the website you can ask them in the [support forum](http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/wdl/categories/ask-the-wdl-team).

## Gitter
There is a [Cromwell gitter channel](https://gitter.im/broadinstitute/cromwell) where people can discuss Cromwell and related topics with both the developers and user community.
