Runtime attributes are used to customize tasks. Within a task one can specify runtime attributes to customize the environment for the call.

For example:

```
task jes_task {
  command {
    echo "Hello JES!"
  }
  runtime {
    docker: "ubuntu:latest"
    memory: "4G"
    cpu: "3"
    zones: "us-central1-c us-central1-b"
    disks: "/mnt/mnt1 3 SSD, /mnt/mnt2 500 HDD"
  }
}
workflow jes_workflow {
  call jes_task
}
```

This table lists the currently available runtime attributes for cromwell:

| Runtime Attribute    | LOCAL |  JES  |  SGE  |
| -------------------- |:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| continueOnReturnCode |   x   |   x   |   x   |
| cpu                  |       |   x   |   x   |
| disks                |       |   x   |       |
| zones                |       |   x   |       |
| docker               |   x   |   x   |   x   |
| failOnStderr         |   x   |   x   |   x   |
| memory               |       |   x   |   x   |
| preemptible          |       |   x   |       |
| bootDiskSizeGb       |       |   x   |       |

Runtime attribute values are interpreted as expressions.  This means that it is possible to express the value of a runtime attribute as a function of one of the task's inputs.  For example:

```
task runtime_test {
  String ubuntu_tag
  Int memory_gb

  command {
    ./my_binary
  }

  runtime {
    docker: "ubuntu:" + ubuntu_tag
    memory: memory_gb + "GB"
  }
}
```

SGE and similar backends may define other configurable runtime attributes beyond the five listed. See [Sun GridEngine](/sge) for more information.

## Specifying Default Values

Default values for runtime attributes can be specified via [workflow options](/workflowoptions).  For example, consider this WDL file:

```wdl
task first {
  command { ... }
}

task second {
  command {...}
  runtime {
    docker: "my_docker_image"
  }
}

workflow w {
  call first
  call second
}
```

And this set of workflow options:

```json
{
  "default_runtime_attributes": {
    "docker": "ubuntu:latest",
    "zones": "us-central1-c us-central1-b"
  }
}
```

Then these values for `docker` and `zones` will be used for any task that does not explicitly override them in the WDL file. So the effective runtime for `task first` is:
```
{
    "docker": "ubuntu:latest",
    "zones": "us-central1-c us-central1-b"
  }
```
And the effective runtime for `task second` is:
```
{
    "docker": "my_docker_image",
    "zones": "us-central1-c us-central1-b"
  }
```
Note how for task second, the WDL value for `docker` is used instead of the default provided in the workflow options.

## continueOnReturnCode

When each task finishes it returns a code. Normally, a non-zero return code indicates a failure. However you can override this behavior by specifying the `continueOnReturnCode` attribute.

When set to false, any non-zero return code will be considered a failure. When set to true, all return codes will be considered successful.

```
runtime {
  continueOnReturnCode: true
}
```

When set to an integer, or an array of integers, only those integers will be considered as successful return codes.

```
runtime {
  continueOnReturnCode: 1
}
```

```
runtime {
  continueOnReturnCode: [0, 1]
}
```

Defaults to "0".

## cpu

Passed to JES: "The minimum number of cores to use."

Passed to SGE, etc.: Configurable, but usually a reservation and/or limit of number of cores.

```
runtime {
  cpu: 2
}
```

Defaults to "1".

## disks

Passed to JES: "Disks to attach."

The disks are specified as a comma separated list of disks. Each disk is further separated as a space separated triplet of:

1. Mount point (absolute path), or `local-disk` to reference the mount point where JES will localize files and the task's current working directory will be
2. Disk size in GB (ignored for disk type LOCAL)
3. Disk type.  One of: "LOCAL", "SSD", or "HDD" ([documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/#overview))

All tasks launched on JES *must* have a `local-disk`.  If one is not specified in the runtime section of the task, then a default of `local-disk 10 SSD` will be used.  The `local-disk` will be mounted to `/cromwell_root`.

The Disk type must be one of "LOCAL", "SSD", or "HDD". When set to "LOCAL", the size of the drive is automatically provisioned by Google so any size specified in WDL will be ignored. All disks are set to auto-delete after the job completes.

**Example 1: Changing the Localization Disk**

```
runtime {
  disks: "local-disk 100 SSD"
}
```

**Example 2: Mounting an Additional Two Disks**

```
runtime {
  disks: "/mnt/my_mnt 3 SSD, /mnt/my_mnt2 500 HDD"
}
```

### Boot Disk
In addition to working disks, JES allows specification of a boot disk size. This is the disk where the docker image itself is booted, **not the working directory of your task on the VM**.
Its primary purpose is to ensure that larger docker images can fit on the boot disk.
```
runtime {
  # Yikes, we have a big OS in this docker image! Allow 50GB to hold it:
  bootDiskSizeGb: 50
}
```

Since no `local-disk` entry is specified, Cromwell will automatically add `local-disk 10 SSD` to this list.

## zones

The ordered list of zone preference (see [Region and Zones](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/zones) documentation for specifics)

The zones are specified as a space separated list, with no commas.

```
runtime {
  zones: "us-central1-c us-central1-b"
}
```

Defaults to the configuration setting `genomics.default-zones` in the JES configuration block which in turn defaults to using `us-central1-b`

## docker

When specified, cromwell will run your task within the specified Docker image.

```
runtime {
  docker: "ubuntu:latest"
}
```

This attribute is mandatory when submitting tasks to JES. When running on other backends, they default to not running the process within Docker.

## failOnStderr

Some programs write to the standard error stream when there is an error, but still return a zero exit code. Set `failOnStderr` to true for these tasks, and it will be considered a failure if anything is written to the standard error stream.

```
runtime {
  failOnStderr: true
}
```

Defaults to "false".

## memory

Passed to JES: "The minimum amount of RAM to use."

Passed to SGE, etc.: Configurable, but usually a reservation and/or limit of memory.

The memory size is specified as an amount and units of memory, for example "4 G".

```
runtime {
  memory: "4G"
}
```

Defaults to "2G".

## preemptible

Passed to JES: "If applicable, preemptible machines may be used for the run."

Take an Int as a value that indicates the maximum number of times Cromwell should request a preemptible machine for this task before defaulting back to a non-preemptible one.
eg. With a value of 1, Cromwell will request a preemptible VM, if the VM is preempted, the task will be retried with a non-preemptible VM.
Note: If specified, this attribute overrides [workflow options](/workflowoptions).

```
runtime {
  preemptible: 1
}
```

Defaults to 0.
