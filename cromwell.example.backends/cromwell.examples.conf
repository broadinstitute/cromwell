  # To customize the metadata database connection, create a block under `database` with the metadata database settings.

  # For example, the default database stores all data in memory. This commented out block would store `metadata` in an
  # hsqldb file, without modifying the internal engine database connection.

  # The value `${uniqueSchema}` is always replaced with a unqiue UUID on each cromwell startup.

  # This feature should be considered experimental and likely to change in the future.
