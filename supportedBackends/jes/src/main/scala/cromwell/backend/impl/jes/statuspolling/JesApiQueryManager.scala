    * Context: the batch.execute() method throws an IOException("insufficient data written") in certain conditions.
    * Here is what we know about it and how this attempts to address the issue.
    * 
    * It was determined empirically that errors start to be thrown when the batch request approaches 15MB.
    * Looking more closely at timing it appears that the exception takes almost exactly 60 seconds to be thrown
    * from the batch.execute method, which suggests that this might be time related rather than byte size related and that
    * the 15MB limit is just an artifact of how much data can be sent / received in 60 seconds by the client / server.
    * 
    * In an attempt to provide a fix for this issue, the total size of the batch size is limited to 14MB, which is a rather
    * arbitrary value only supported by local testing.
    * 
    * Result of further investigation on the cause:
    * IOException("insufficient data written") is being thrown because the http request attempts to close() its output stream.
    * The close() method throws the "insufficient data written" exception because it still had data to send.
    * The close() method was called as part of a finally, because an exception was thrown earlier when attempting to write to the
    * stream. This exception is however swallowed by the one thrown in the close().
    * This commit https://github.com/google/google-http-java-client/pull/333 fixes the swallowing issue so the original 
    * exception is thrown instead: IOException(“Error writing request body to server”).
    * Tracing back why this exception is being thrown, it appears that at some point the socket gets closed externally
    * (maybe the google server closes it ?)
    * which results in a SocketException("broken pipe") being thrown and eventually bubbles up to the IOExceptions above.
    * 
    * see sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection
    * and com.google.api.client.http.javanet.NetHttpRequest
