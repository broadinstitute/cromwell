## Performance Testing

This performance testing process happens as part of the release into FireCloud.

* **Note:** This process is non-blocking and optional for HOTFIX releases.
* **Note:** For now we will still let QA know that we are running a perf test for a Cromwell release. They might want to double-check that we did it right.
