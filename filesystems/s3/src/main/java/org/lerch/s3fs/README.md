An **Amazon AWS S3** FileSystem Provider **JSR-203** for Java 8 (NIO2) using the AWS SDK v2.

This version uses the released version of the AWS SDK v2 and is forked from
[Emil Lerch's S3 FileSystem](https://github.com/elerch/Amazon-S3-FileSystem-NIO2/tree/e8283b5).
That version uses a preview version of the AWS SDK v2 and is forked from
[Upplication's S3 FileSystem](https://github.com/upplication/Amazon-S3-FileSystem-NIO2).

The previous fork did not update the tests for AWS SDK v2, so the tests targeting AWS SDK v1 have been left out of this
fork.
