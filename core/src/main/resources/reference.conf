  # Cromwell centralizes some operations through singleton actors (possibly acting as routers).
  # This allows for a more efficient control, throttling, and potentially batching of those operations which overall improves throughput.
  # In order to do that, those operations are queued until they can be performed.
  # Those queues are for the most part unbounded in size, which can become a problem under heavy load.
  # Each actor can however let the load controller service know when it considers its work load to be abnormally high.
  # In the case of those queuing actors, this means that their queue size is over a certain threshold.
  # This section allows to configure those threshold values.
  # They should be kept at a reasonable number where reasonable will depend on your system and how much load Cromwell is submitted to.
  # If they're too high they could end up using a lot of memory, if they're too small any small spike will be considered a high load and the system will automatically slow itself down.
  # Benchmarking is recommended to find the values that suit your use case best.
  # If you use the statsD instrumentation service, the queue size and throughput of these actors are instrumented and looking at their value over time can also help you find the right configuration.
