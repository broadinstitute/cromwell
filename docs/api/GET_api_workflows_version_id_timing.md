_For the Doc-A-Thon_  
**Questions to answer and things to consider:**

1. Who is visiting the API/timing diagram page?  

2. What do they need to know first?  
*Tell them how to get the timing diagram, how do they see it?*
3. Is all the important information there? If not, add it!  
*How should someone interpret the timing diagram?*
4. Are there things that don't need to be there? Remove them.  

5. Are the code and instructions accurate? Try it!
