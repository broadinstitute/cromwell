# pullRequests.frequency allows to control how often or when Scala Steward
# is allowed to create pull requests.
#
# Possible values:
#   @asap
#     PRs are created without delay.
#
#   @daily | @weekly | @monthly
#     PRs are created at least 1 day | 7 days | 30 days after the last PR.
#
#   <CRON expression>
#     PRs are created roughly according to the given CRON expression.
#
#     CRON expressions consist of five fields:
#     minutes, hour of day, day of month, month, and day of week.
#
#     See https://www.alonsodomin.me/cron4s/userguide/index.html#parsing for
#     more information about the CRON expressions that are supported.
#
#     Note that the date parts of the CRON expression are matched exactly
#     while the the time parts are only used to abide to the frequency of
#     the given expression.
#
# Default: @asap
#
pullRequests.frequency = "0 0 1 1,4,7,10 ?" # Run at 00:00 on the 1st day of Jan,Apr,Jul,Oct (whatever day that is)

# Only these dependencies which match the given patterns are updated.
#
# Each pattern must have `groupId`, and may have `artifactId` and `version`.
# Defaults to empty `[]` which mean Scala Steward will update all dependencies.
# updates.allow  = [ { groupId = "com.example" } ]

# The dependencies which match the given version pattern are updated.
# Dependencies that are not listed will be updated.
#
# Each pattern must have `groupId`, `version` and optional `artifactId`.
# Defaults to empty `[]` which mean Scala Steward will update all dependencies.
# the following example will allow to update foo when version is 1.1.x
# updates.pin  = [ { groupId = "com.example", artifactId="foo", version = "1.1." } ]

# The dependencies which match the given pattern are NOT updated.
#
# Each pattern must have `groupId`, and may have `artifactId` and `version`.
# Defaults to empty `[]` which mean Scala Steward will not ignore dependencies.
# updates.ignore = [ { groupId = "org.acme", artifactId="foo", version = "1.0" } ]

# If set, Scala Steward will only attempt to create or update `n` PRs.
# Useful if running frequently and/or CI build are costly
# Default: None
# updates.limit = 5

# By default, Scala Steward does not update scala version since its tricky, error-prone
# and results in bad PRs and/or failed builds
# If set to true, Scala Steward will attempt to update the scala version
# Since this feature is experimental, the default is set to false
# Default: false
# updates.includeScala = true

# The extensions of files that should be updated.
# Default: [".scala", ".sbt", ".sbt.shared", ".sc", ".yml", "pom.xml"]
# updates.fileExtensions = [".scala", ".sbt", ".sbt.shared", ".sc", ".yml", ".md", ".markdown", ".txt"]

# If "on-conflicts", Scala Steward will update the PR it created to resolve conflicts as
# long as you don't change it yourself.
# If "always", Scala Steward will always update the PR it created as long as
# you don't change it yourself.
# If "never", Scala Steward will never update the PR
# Default: "on-conflicts"
# updatePullRequests = "always" | "on-conflicts" | "never"

# If set, Scala Steward will use this message template for the commit messages and PR titles.
# Supported variables: ${artifactName}, ${currentVersion}, ${nextVersion} and ${default}
# Default: "${default}" which is equivalent to "Update ${artifactName} to ${nextVersion}"
commits.message = "Scala-Steward: Update ${artifactName} from ${currentVersion} to ${nextVersion}"
