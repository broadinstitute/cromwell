Duplicated Cromwell `biscayne` into `cascades` to serve as new home for OpenWDL `development` version. Grammar synced from OpenWDL.
Will become WDL 1.2 or 2.0.
Some Terra users run `version development` WDLs, we don't officially support it, but shouldn't break it too badly if possible.

When changing the grammar file, generate a new parser by:
- changing current working directory to cromwell/wdl/transforms/cascades
- running: hermes generate src/main/resources/grammar.hgr \
          --language=java \
          --directory=src/main/java \
          --name=wdl \
          --java-package=wdl.cascades.parser \
          --java-use-apache-commons --java-imports=org.apache.commons.lang3.StringEscapeUtils \
          --header
