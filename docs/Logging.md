Cromwell accepts two Java Properties or Environment Variables for controlling logging:

* `LOG_MODE` - Accepts either `pretty` or `standard` (default `pretty`).  In `standard` mode, logs will be written without ANSI escape code coloring, with a layout more appropriate for server logs, versus `pretty` that is easier to read for a single workflow run.
* `LOG_LEVEL` - Level at which to log (default `info`).

Additionally, a directory may be set for writing per workflow logs. By default, the per workflow logs will be erased once the workflow completes.

```hocon
// In application.conf or specified via system properties
workflow-options {
    workflow-log-dir: "cromwell-workflow-logs"
    workflow-log-temporary: true
}
```

The usual case of generating the temporary per workflow logs is to copy them to a remote directory, while deleting the local copy to preserve local disk space. To specify the remote directory to copy the logs to use the separate [workflow option](#workflow-options) `final_workflow_log_dir`.

Cromwell supports [Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io), a service that can be used to monitor exceptions reported in an application's logs. To make use of this add `-Dsentry.dsn=DSN_URL` to your Java command line with your DSN URL.
