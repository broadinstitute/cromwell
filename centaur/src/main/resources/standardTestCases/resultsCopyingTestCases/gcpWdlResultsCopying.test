# Will run on a Cromwell that supports any one of these backends
backendsMode: any

# Asserting on the source file `gs://cloud-cromwell-dev-self-cleaning/.../simpleStdoutTask.log` currently fails on Batch.
# This is because Batch does not produce a `simpleStdoutTask.log` and instead sends logs go to Cloud Logging. Burwood is going to add a config to allow the old behavior.
# PR for file-based task logs is merged but currently the task logs are not named the same
backends: [Papi, Papiv2, GCPBATCH_NEEDS_ALT]
