**Support Forum**

If you have questions that aren't covered by this documentation you can ask them in the
[Support Forum](http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/wdl/categories/ask-the-wdl-team).
Please note that despite the `wdl` currently in its name, this is a forum that supports Cromwell users too.

**Website and User Guide**

The [WDL website](https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl/) is the best place to go for more information on WDL.
In particular new users should check out the [user guide](https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl/userguide/)
which has many tutorials, examples and other bits to get you started.
