/**
 * Designed explicitly for the use case of the 'run' functionality in Main. This Actor will start a workflow,
 * print out the outputs when complete and then shut down the actor system. Note that multiple aspects of this
 * are sub-optimal for future use cases where one might want a single workflow being run.
 *
 * NOTE: This Actor listens to FSM transition messages to keep an eye on the WorkflowActor. However, when the FSM
 * transitions to a "terminated" state, it is just starting to asynchronously begin more work in response to the same
 * message. This work includes persisting the run state to the DB, before it sends a special message to itself to
 * actually halt the Actor instance. (Side note, the halt only appears to be received in state WorkflowSucceeded, not
 * WorkflowFailed?)
 *
 * Unfortunately, we sense this "terminated" state of WorkflowSucceeded/WorkflowFailure, and then send a message to the
 * system to shut down, sometimes before the WorkflowActor has actually persisted its final state. During testing, it
 * also shuts down the system before the WorkflowActor finishes using system internals. In one example, when the
 * WorkflowActor tries to activate a special call to setTimer, the system is already gone, resulting in an internal
 * NullPointerException.
 *
 * All this messaging and FSM state needs help. There are other tools available too, besides FSM state, for example one
 * could also register a context.watch() on the WorkflowActor to make sure it's really done. A simpler alternative may
 * be a "Now I'm **really** done" message from the WorkflowActor.
