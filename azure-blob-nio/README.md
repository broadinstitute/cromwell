# Azure Storage Blob NIO FileSystemProvider

[This is a copy of the NIO Filesystem implementation version 12.0.0-beta.19](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/2490e1e19e8531fe0a6378f40e299e7ec64cf3aa/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob-nio)

For more information on the initial design and commit history see the Azure SDK repository linked above. Changes to this repo were necessary to support some of the specific needs Cromwell as an App on Azure has as a system in Terra. This is something that has some precedent as it has been done for other filesystems in the past.
