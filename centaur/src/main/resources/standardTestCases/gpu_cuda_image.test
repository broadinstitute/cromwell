# As of November 2024, GCP Batch was using driver 550 and Life Sciences 535.
# Neither was on the 418 version that used to be specified in this test.
#
# On Life Sciences it seems to be straight up ignored by the API.
#
# In Batch it is not wired through Cromwell, and we may not do so if we don't find a reason to.
