Synced grammar from OpenWDL `development` version, which is actually development of 2.0. There is no 1.1 Hermes grammar, develop it here.
Changed version declaration to `development1_1`.
This disallows `version 1.1` workflows to run with incomplete support. Once development is finished, change to `1.1`.
