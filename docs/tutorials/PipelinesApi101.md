## Getting started on Google Cloud with the Genomics Pipelines API

## Pipelines API v2

### Basic Information

Initial support for Google [Pipelines API version 2](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/reference/rest/) was added in Cromwell 32.
Expect feature parity with v1 except:

* PAPI v2 private Docker support is equivalent to that in PAPI v1 but the configuration differs, please see [Docker configuration](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/filesystems/Google#Docker) for more details.
* The "refresh token" authentication mode is **NOT** supported on PAPI V2.

In addition, the following changes are to be expected:

* Error messages for failed jobs might differ from V1
* The Pipelines API log file content might differ from V1

### Setting up PAPIv2

For now the easiest way to try PAPIv2 is to migrate an existing set up from PAPIv1 (see below). After that, copy the PAPIv2 sample configuration in [cromwell.examples.conf](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/cromwell.examples.conf) in place of the PAPIv1 backend.

#### Permissions:

With Pipelines API v2, the mode of authentication (ie, Application Default, User Service Account, default compute service account, etc) will need to have these permissions on the bucket holding the Cromwell directory (root directory):

* storage.objects.list
* storage.objects.create
* storage.objects.delete

## Pipelines API v1

### Deprecation warning

Please note that Google intends to deprecate PAPIv1 in the near future (circa mid 2019 or perhaps earlier).

### Goals

At the end of this tutorial you'll have run your first workflow against the Google Pipelines API.

### Let's get started!


**Configuring a Google Project**

Install the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads" target="_blank">Google Cloud SDK</a>. 
Create a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects" target="_blank">Google Cloud Project</a> and give it a project id (e.g. sample-project).  Weâ€™ll refer to this as `<google-project-id>` and your user login (e.g. username@gmail.com) as `<google-user-id>`.  

On your Google project, open up the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library" target="_blank">API Manager</a> and enable the following APIs:
        
* Google Compute Engine
* Google Cloud Storage
* Genomics API

Authenticate to Google Cloud Platform  
`gcloud auth login <google-user-id>`

Set your default account (will require to login again)  
`gcloud auth application-default login`

Set your default project  
`gcloud config set project <google-project-id>`

Create a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket to hold Cromwell execution directories.
We will refer to this bucket as `google-bucket-name`, and the full identifier as `gs://google-bucket-name`.  
`gsutil mb gs://<google-bucket-name>`  


**Workflow Source Files**

Copy over the sample `hello.wdl` and `hello.inputs` files to the same directory as the Cromwell jar. 
This workflow takes a string value as specified in the inputs file and writes it to stdout. 


***hello.wdl***
```
task hello {
  String addressee  
  command {
    echo "Hello ${addressee}! Welcome to Cromwell . . . on Google Cloud!"  
  }
  output {
    String message = read_string(stdout())
  }
  runtime {
    docker: "ubuntu:latest"
  }
}

workflow wf_hello {
  call hello

  output {
     hello.message
  }
}
```

***hello.inputs***
```
{
  "wf_hello.hello.addressee": "World"
}
```

**Google Configuration File**

Copy over the sample `google.conf` file utilizing <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials" target="_blank">Application Default credentials</a> to the same directory that contains your sample WDL, inputs and Cromwell jar.
Replace `<google-project-id>` and `<google-bucket-name>`in the configuration file with the project id and bucket name. Replace `<google-billing-project-id>` with the project id that has to be billed for the request (more information for Requester Pays can be found at:
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/requester-pays" target="_blank">Requester Pays</a>)

***google.conf***
```
include required(classpath("application"))

google {

  application-name = "cromwell"

  auths = [
    {
      name = "application-default"
      scheme = "application_default"
    }
  ]
}

engine {
  filesystems {
    gcs {
      auth = "application-default"
      project = "<google-billing-project-id>"
    }
  }
}

backend {
  default = "JES"
  providers {
    JES {
      actor-factory = "cromwell.backend.impl.jes.JesBackendLifecycleActorFactory"
      config {
        // Google project
        project = "<google-project-id>"

        // Base bucket for workflow executions
        root = "gs://<google-bucket-name>/cromwell-execution"

        // Polling for completion backs-off gradually for slower-running jobs.
        // This is the maximum polling interval (in seconds):
        maximum-polling-interval = 600

        // Optional Dockerhub Credentials. Can be used to access private docker images.
        dockerhub {
          // account = ""
          // token = ""
        }

        genomics {
          // A reference to an auth defined in the `google` stanza at the top.  This auth is used to create
          // Pipelines and manipulate auth JSONs.
          auth = "application-default"
          // Endpoint for APIs, no reason to change this unless directed by Google.
          endpoint-url = "https://genomics.googleapis.com/"
          // This allows you to use an alternative service account to launch jobs, by default uses default service account
          compute-service-account = "default"

          // Pipelines v2 only: specify the number of times localization and delocalization operations should be attempted
          // There is no logic to determine if the error was transient or not, everything is retried upon failure
          // Defaults to 3
          localization-attempts = 3
        }

        filesystems {
          gcs {
            // A reference to a potentially different auth for manipulating files via engine functions.
            auth = "application-default"
            project = "<google-billing-project-id>"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Run Workflow**

`java -Dconfig.file=google.conf -jar cromwell-29.jar run hello.wdl -i hello.inputs`

**Outputs**

The end of your workflow logs should report the workflow outputs.  

```
[info] SingleWorkflowRunnerActor workflow finished with status 'Succeeded'.
{
  "outputs": {
    "wf_hello.hello.message": "Hello World! Welcome to Cromwell . . . on Google Cloud!"
  },
  "id": "08213b40-bcf5-470d-b8b7-1d1a9dccb10e"
}
```

Success!
