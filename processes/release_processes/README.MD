# Release Processes

## How to update these processes

## Core Process: How to Publish and Release Cromwell

Cromwell versions are updated on a weekly cadence automatically. For more information see [here](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/9512163608731-Faster-Cromwell-updates-in-Terra-)

Manually cutting a numeric release is expected to continue being done on a cadence of every ~6 months. If you're the lucky "Release Rotation Engineer" this time, you should do the following four things:

1. Create a Jira ticket for the release (look at previous release tickets if you're not sure how). In the Suggested
Release Notes field, add "Terra is now running Cromwell <version>" along with any other release notes relevant to Terra
users.
1. Check that all most recent executions of Cromwell's Jenkins tests have succeeded, and that all those executions were
against the most recent commit in "develop" branch. There are 2 groups of Jenkins tests which have to be checked (you
will need to be on the Broad internal network or VPN to open the following links):
    1. Tests for various backends supported by Cromwell. Log into Jenkins [here](https://fc-jenkins.dsp-techops.broadinstitute.org), check the tests [here](https://fc-jenkins.dsp-techops.broadinstitute.org/job/cromwell-cron-parent/).
    1. Tests for Cromwell in Terra environment. Log into Jenkins [here](https://fc-jenkins.dsp-techops.broadinstitute.org), check the tests [here](https://fc-jenkins.dsp-techops.broadinstitute.org/view/Batch/).
1. [Run the publish script to create a new version of Cromwell](#how-to-publish-a-new-cromwell-version)
1. [Run through the "How to Deploy Cromwell in CaaS prod" process](#how-to-deploy-cromwell-in-caas-staging-and-caas-prod)

### How to publish a new Cromwell version

#### Announce your intentions

Post a message in `#dsp-workflows-private` letting people know that a publish is imminent in case there are PRs they want to get
wrapped up and merged to `develop` to go out in the forthcoming version of Cromwell.

#### Get a Github token

The release WDL uses a github token to perform actions on your behalf.
* Follow the directions [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).
  When asked give the token these exact permissions ([example screenshot](github_token_scopes.png)):
  * the full set of `repo` permissions
  * the `workflow` permission
  * only the `read:org` permission (do not let this token administer your organizations!)
  * only the `user:email` permission (do not let this token administer your user!)
* When viewing the token in the [list-view of tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens), its scopes string should read exactly `read:org, repo, user:email, workflow`
* Copy the token and save it to a file on your local machine, for example `~/.github-token`. You'll use it in a second.

#### Prepare a temporary `release` directory

Make or copy the following files into a temporary `release/` directory outside the Cromwell repository. This removes any chance of committing your token.

* A copy of the workflow file to run (https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/publish/publish_workflow.wdl)
* An inputs json like this one.
  * `publishHomebrew` is `false` due to Homebrew taking on this part themselves. Homebrew remains an active distribution channel.

```json
{
  "publish_workflow.githubToken": "<<GITHUB TOKEN VALUE>>",
  "publish_workflow.majorRelease": true,
  "publish_workflow.publishHomebrew": false,
  "publish_workflow.publishDocker": "broadinstitute/cromwell-publish:latest",
  "publish_workflow.organization": "broadinstitute"
}
```

#### Make sure Docker will have enough memory

Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#resources) to increase Docker memory.
Ensure you have at least 8GB; 4GB is not sufficient.

#### Let people know the publish is underway

Post another message in `#dsp-workflows-private` that the release is underway, asking everyone to hold off merges to `develop` until
the release is published.

#### Run the `publish_workflow.wdl` Workflow

Run Cromwell in server mode with a persistent backing database, using Docker containers. This allows call caching to happen if you need to restart for any reason.
See instructions for using a Dockerized MySQL server and CI config [here](#cromwell-setup-for-publishing).

Note that the publish workflow is quite resource intensive; it's a good idea to shut down other resource intensive apps before launching it to avoid painfully slow or failed executions.

Make sure to plug in your laptop.

Using the Swagger API at `http://localhost:8000`, submit the workflow to Cromwell along with the inputs file.

The workflow outputs its status to the console.

#### Make sure it all went swimmingly

* Check that the workflow succeeded.
* Check that there's now a new Cromwell release listed [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/releases).
* Let `#dsp-workflows-private` know that it's okay to resume merges to `develop`.
* Announce release in `#dsp-workflows`, set expectations about when the new version will be available in Terra.
* **One business day later,** confirm that [the Homebrew package](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cromwell) has the latest version. If it doesn't, start investigation by looking at [Homebrew PR's](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pulls?q=is%3Apr+cromwell).

### Publish Docker Image
* If the release workflow went well, it's time to also publish Docker images for this release. 
* `git checkout` the Cromwell hash that was just published (i.e. the one directly BEFORE the "Update Cromwell version from x to x+1" commit that the publish WDL makes). It's important that the image being built uses the exact same code as the .jar files published to github.
* Run `sbt -Dproject.isSnapshot=false -Dproject.isRelease=true dockerBuildAndPush` from your local Cromwell directory. 
* Grab a cup of coffee, and verify that all of the new images were pushed successfully. For example, you should now be able to do `docker pull broadinstitute/cromwell:{new version #}`
  * The list of images is `cromwell`, `cromiam`, `cromwell-drs-localizer`, and `womtool`

### How to Deploy Cromwell in CaaS staging and CaaS prod

CaaS is "Cromwell as a Service". It is used by a couple of Broad teams (Pipelines and Epigenomics), though the long-term plan is for those teams to migrate to using Terra.

**Note:** If the Cromwell CHANGELOG indicates that the upgrade might take some time (e.g., because of a database migration), checking in with the CaaS users
to let them know that the upgrade is about to happen is a good idea.

Deploying to CaaS is detailed in the [Quick CaaS Deployment Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s0YC-oohJ7o-OGcgnH_-YBtIEKmLIPTRpG36yvWxUpE)

### How to be Sure You're Done

Don't forget to confirm that [the Homebrew package](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cromwell) was updated!

## Bonus Processes

The Swagger client library is not part of our core publish/release process but can be performed from time to time, as required.

### How to Generate and Publish Swagger Client Library

**Note:** This part of publishing may or may not work for you until
[BT-38](https://broadworkbench.atlassian.net/browse/BT-38) is finished and this section is updated.

The first step is to generate the client library.  From the root of the repo run

```
./scripts/gen_java_client.sh
```

This generates the client library and runs the generated tests as well.  A successful run should end with something similar to

```
[debug] Test run finished: 0 failed, 0 ignored, 7 total, 0.007s
[info] Passed: Total 103, Failed 0, Errors 0, Passed 100, Skipped 3
[success] Total time: 4 s, completed Jun 26, 2019 3:01:19 PM
```

To publish to artifactory, first obtain the artifactory username and credentials. Credentials are located in Vault at path `secret/dsde/cromwell/common/cromwell-artifactory`. Then run

```
export ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME=<the-username>
export ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD=<the-password>
./scripts/publish-client.sh
```

A SNAP version of the client library will be published in jFrog at [this path](https://broadinstitute.jfrog.io/ui/repos/tree/General/libs-release-local/org/broadinstitute/cromwell).

## Cromwell setup for publishing

One can run a publishing-friendly Cromwell using a containerized MySQL server and config files
from Cromwell's CI. See the `start_publish_mysql_docker.sh` and `start_publish_cromwell.sh`
scripts under `release_processes/scripts`.
