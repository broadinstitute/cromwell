_For the Doc-A-Thon_  
**Questions to answer and things to consider:**

1. Who is visiting the Home page?  
*evaluators of Cromwell. People wondering what the heck it is*
2. What do they need to know first?  
*highlights: what is Cromwell for?*
3. Is all the important information there? If not, add it!  

4. Are there things that don't need to be there? Remove them.  
*referencing wikipedia twice in the first sentence? we can do better!*
5. Are the code and instructions accurate? Try it!
