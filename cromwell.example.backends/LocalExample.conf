# This is an example of how you can use the LocalExample backend to define
# a new backend provider. *This is not a complete configuration file!* The
# content here should be copy pasted into the backend -> providers section
# of the cromwell.examples.conf in the root of the repository. You should
# uncomment lines that you want to define, and read carefully to customize
# the file. If you have any questions, please open an issue at
