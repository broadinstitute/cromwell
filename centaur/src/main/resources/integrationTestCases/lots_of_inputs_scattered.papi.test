testFormat: workflowsuccess
# This test usually runs successfully but its scale presents a lot of challenges for CI.
# Too much log output to run on Travis, > 1 million metadata rows in the db, Akka HTTP response size nearly 1 GiB
# (after numerous failed retry attempts), and "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space" on Jenkins workers.
# `ignore`ing for now but hopefully can be re-enabled in Jenkins if full metadata fetches can be sidestepped (BT-380)
# or perhaps migrated to the Cromwell perf environment.
