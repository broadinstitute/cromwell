        There's some trickery going on here. We've updated the labels in the metadata store but almost certainly when
        the store received the GetLabels request above the summarizer will not have been run so our new values are
        not present. Instead we'll fake it by manually merging what the metadata store has, as well as the new updated
        values.

        There's a potential flaw here in that a second PATCH request to the labels endpoint could come in prior to
        summarization and thus the response to the user would lose the previous updates, but we can cross that bridge
        if it becomes a problem. So if you find yourself debugging why previously updated labels aren't showing up in
        the return packet, this is a likely cause.
