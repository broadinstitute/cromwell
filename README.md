## Welcome to Cromwell

Cromwell is an open-source Workflow Management System for bioinformatics. Licensing is [BSD 3-Clause](LICENSE.txt).

The [Cromwell documentation has a dedicated site](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable).

First time to Cromwell? Get started with [Tutorials](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/FiveMinuteIntro/).

### Community

Cromwell has a growing ecosystem of community-backed projects to make your experience even better! Check out our [Ecosystem](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Ecosystem/) page to learn more.

Talk to us:
- [Join the Cromwell Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/cromwellhq/shared_invite/zt-dxmmrtye-JHxwKE53rfKE_ZWdOHIB4g) to discuss the Cromwell workflow engine.
- [Join the OpenWDL Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/openwdl/shared_invite/zt-ctmj4mhf-cFBNxIiZYs6SY9HgM9UAVw) to discuss the evolution of the WDL language itself.
    - More information about WDL is available in [that project's repository](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl).  

### Capabilities and roadmap

A majority of Cromwell users today run their workflows in [Terra](https://app.terra.bio/), a fully-managed cloud-native bioinformatics computing platform. See [here](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360036379771-Get-started-running-workflows) for a quick-start guide.

Users with specialized needs who wish to install and maintain their own Cromwell instances can [download](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/releases) a JAR or Docker image. The development team accepts reproducible bug reports from self-managed instances, but cannot feasibly provide direct support.

[Cromwell's backends](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/Backends/) receive development resources proportional to customer demand. The team is actively developing for Google Cloud and AWS. Maintenance of other backends is primarily community-based.

Cromwell [supports](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/LanguageSupport/) the WDL and CWL workflow languages. The Cromwell team is actively developing WDL, while maintenance for CWL is primarily community-based.
